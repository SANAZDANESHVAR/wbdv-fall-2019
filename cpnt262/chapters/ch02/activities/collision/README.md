# Activity: Simple web server
Use what you've learned about node built modules http, fs and url: build a simple web server that:
- successfully serves the index.html file in this directory with a status code of 200
- successfully serves each of the subsequent js and css files with status codes of 200
- serves a "page not found" file (can be dynamic) with a status code of 404 when the requested file doesn't exist.
