# Assignment 3: Website Proposal
You will work in teams of 4-5 to create a website proposal for a real or fictitious company.

The website proposal should include:

## A. Project Overview
List site challenges and possible solutions. You may include examples of other sites that address the challenges.

## B. Goals
Define and list your website goals, objectives and messages .

## C. Audience
Write a brief description of the intended audience for this website.

## D. Delivery Requirements
Define the technologies you will need to create the website (e.g., Photoshop, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, etc.). Be sure to include any constraints the delivery requirements place on the site.

## E. Site Content
Provide an inventory of the home page and content pages, including standard structures on the pages. Be sure to include the use of tables, headings and indentation to maintain page structure and consistency and hierarchy.

## F. Site Structure
Draw a flowchart of the site, listing each page and major section.

## G. Visual Design
Define the look and feel of your website, choice of colours and fonts and create a mockup design or two, include the splash page and one content page. Identify similar sites â€“ list the URLs or provide screen shots and note how your site will improve on or be different from the sites you have looked at.

## H. Budget
Prepare a budget based on the number of hours that will be required to complete the website. Assume your work rate is $60/hr or $100 per web page. Include any costs for additional media that might be required (e.g. web hosting, language translation, etc.).

## I. Promotional Plan
Outline strategies for promoting the website using search engine optimization and social media.
 
Each website proposal should have a cover page that clearly identifies the website title, student names, contact information, date and the purpose the proposal is being prepared for. The proposal should be between 5 and 10 pages.

Website proposals are helpful in the production process and serve as an important tool for communicating with the client.

The website proposal is to be handed in at the end of Day 2 and is worth 50% of your total grade. All students within the group will receive the same grade.
