# Build a Shopping Cart
## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to set up and configure an online shopping site for a small business using a popular Ecommerce server application. You will continue working in your Business Justification groups. Day 3 of the course will be provided as a work day to complete this assignment.

## Value
This lab has a maximum score of 21 and is worth 60% of your grade.

## Due
The site will be demonstrated to the instructor on the afternoon of Day 3 at 1:30pm.

## Directions
Set up an online store for the small business you presented during the Business Justification assignment.

Download a copy of an open source shopping cart system. You may choose whichever system you'd like. Some choices include osCommerce, Zencart, and WooCommerce on WordPress.

After the installation is complete, explore the management menus and customize your store: 

## Requirements

1. Find graphics for at least 5 products and set the products up in the catalogue. Make up your own descriptions and pricing.
2. Clean the demo products out of the installation.
3. The business wants to be able to ship across Canada, the United States and Mexico, providing same-day service, 1-2 week, and 3-6 week delivery options with a flat rate for each. Make up your prices, but Canada will be the cheapest, the U.S. will be higher and Mexico will be the highest.
4. Set up the payment modules to accept PayPal, Visa and Mastercard.
5. Set up the tax regions so that Alberta shoppers do not pay any provincial sales tax, but all Canadian shoppers pay the GST. For the United States and Mexico, set them up with a 20% sales tax.
6. Since the store wants to do business in Canada, the United States and Mexico, ensure that these three currencies will be accepted.
7. Additional Configuration:
  - Set the store up with a custom logo.
  - Alter the colour scheme or use a custom theme. 
  - Ensure that customers can post product reviews.
  - Add any extra customizations that you would like to try.
