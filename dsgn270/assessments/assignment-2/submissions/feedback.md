- Wireframes don't include the whole page, top to bottom

## Moe
- Wireframes are not supposed to use colour or real images. Their purpose is to test layouts before you get to that stage.
- No additional comments are offered on the designs.

## Quentin
- Some lorem ipsum changes in word count across designs, which violates content parity.

- Great work!

## Fernanda
- Some elements (such as the map) are missing on the smaller wireframes, which violates content parity.
- No additional comments are offered on the designs. For example, a note that the menu on the right opens when you click the hanburger menu. Does it slide in? Fade in?

## Julia
- Excellent work!

## Daniel
- The tablet and desktop wireframes look nearly identical.

- No additional comments are offered on the designs.

## Kate
- Excellent work!

## Sonya
- The wireframes are missing most of the content in the real site. This violates content parity.
- The wireframes only use one card: an image (I assume) and a title. There is not enough variation in this design to account for most of the content on the real site. This is the point of a wireframe.

- The mobile version would be too cramped and unrealistic. Content should be in one column to account for the smaller screen width.
