## Roy
- I love the PRO/CON format
- Information architecture is confused with search engine optimization (SEO). IA is concerned with how content is presented to the user after they have reached the site, not with how they find the site.

## Moe
- There is no introduction to the paper, which should state your goal (an analysis of a website) and/or the paper's context (assignment, mock-analysis, etc).

## Quentin
- The text needs to be more scannable. Use more headings, shorter paragraphs and add white space (with bullet points, for example)
- Your points should be organized into the categories laid out in the assignment rubric (usability, user experience, accessibility, information architecture and content). None of these terms (beyond "user friendly") were used in your analysis, which hurt your scores. For example, your comments about the navigation and lack of search bar should be explicitly mentioned as information architecture to demonstrate your knowledge of the term.
- In general, the paper is long to read and difficult to follow

## Nathan
- Great work! The only improvement I can recommend is the use of headings to make the content more scannable
- "An exquisite example..." is a great touch

## Fernanda
- The perceived goal of the website isn't mentioned.
- An introduction into the purpose and context of your paper would help any readers that aren't familiar with this assignment.
- The paper ends rather abruptly. A conclusion that ties together your insights would have been better.
- In general, the paper is a little light on content.

## Julia
- Great work!

## Daniel
- The paper could use a title and introduction to give the content some context for readers that are not familiar with the assignment.
- The perceived goals of the website are not stated

## Kate
- Excellent work!

## Sonya
- The text needs to be more scannable. Use more headings, shorter paragraphs and add white space (with bullet points, for example)

## Kari
- The paper needs an introduction and conclusion to give the content some context for readers that are not familiar with the assignment.
- The perceived goals of the website are not stated (besides "keep it simple").
- "It doesnâ€™t use the proper color scheme because the font is hard to read." Doesn't belong in the Information Architecture section.
- There are many form accessibility problems that were not mentioned (no labels, fieldset or legend tags)

## Nonso
- The paper needs an introduction and more flushed out conclusion to give the content some context for readers that are not familiar with the assignment.
- The perceived goals of the website are not stated clearly.

## Katherine
- The text needs to be more scannable. Use more headings, shorter paragraphs and add white space (with more bullet points like you used for accessbility, for example)
- Your points should be organized into the categories laid out in the assignment rubric (usability, user experience, accessibility, information architecture and content). None of these terms were used in your analysis, which hurt your scores. For example, your comments about the navigation should be explicitly mentioned as information architecture or usability to demonstrate your knowledge of the terms.
- The paper ends rather abruptly. A conclusion that ties together your insights would have been better.

Comments:
- This paper should be written as a professional review that could be sent to a client. Your writing style is far too informal.
- The text needs to be more scannable. Use more headings, shorter paragraphs and add white space
- Your points should be organized into the categories laid out in the assignment rubric (usability, user experience, accessibility, information architecture and content).
- The paper ends rather abruptly. A conclusion that ties together your insights would have been better.

## Floyd
- The paper needs an introduction and more flushed out conclusion to give the content some context for readers that are not familiar with the assignment.
- None of the content under Accessibility really has anything to do with users with disabilities
- The content for Usability is a little lacking
- The content for User Experience is mostly just listing the site features and site map. Providing more insight into what worked and what didn't (and why) would have earned more marks.

## Mitch
- Great work!
- One point of improvement is the Accessibility section. None of the comments have to do with people with disabilites (i.e. use of sematic tags, form labels, the ability to tab by keyboard, etc). 

## Lord

- I liked the questions you conluded the paper with.

## Mallory
- The text needs to be more scannable. Use more headings, shorter paragraphs.
- Your points should be organized into the categories laid out in the assignment rubric (usability, user experience, accessibility, information architecture and content).
- In general, your content is great but the paper is hard to read due to large blocks of text.
